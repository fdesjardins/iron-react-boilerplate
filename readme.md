# iron-react-starter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fdesjardins/iron-react-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fdesjardins/iron-react-starter)

> React front end on a Rust and Iron back end

## Features
- React
- Redux
- React Router Redux
- Webpack
- Babel
- PostCSS
- Local Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 Authentication
- PostgreSQL
- Flash Notifications
- Redis Sessions

## Why?

Mainly for me to learn how to put these things together coherently. There are some compelling advantages of running React on a Rust back end though. Performance, of course, but also interesting things like concurrency errors at runtime and safe handling of server resources like sockets.
